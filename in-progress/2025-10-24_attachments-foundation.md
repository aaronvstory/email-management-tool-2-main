# Attachments & Release Hardening – Progress Log (October 24, 2025)

## Context Snapshot
- **Feature theme**: End-to-end attachments handling across held email quick view, modal editor, and full viewer, including eventual MIME rebuild with release locks/idempotency.
- **Reference plan**: "E2E Attachments & Release Hardening Plan — Email Interception System" (see `plan-*` docs at repo root for full sequence).
- **Current phase**: Phase 1 foundation (schema, extraction, read-only list + download) behind feature flag.

## Environment & Tooling
- **Serena MCP**: Activated project `Email-Management-Tool`, onboarding completed, symbol/index lookups used for `init_database`, `api_interception_release`, and template references.
- **Desktop-Commander MCP**: Used for directory creation, file edits via `apply_patch`, and shell commands (pytest attempt, git status).
- **Chrome DevTools MCP**: Not yet invoked (deferred until UI fully interactive for Phase 2+ testing).
- **Branch**: Working on `fix/cleanup-commit-b8557ab` (dirty tree inherited). No new branch created yet per instructions.

## Key Changes Implemented
1. **Configuration Flags** (`config/config.py:90`)
   - Added attachment feature toggles (`ATTACHMENTS_UI_ENABLED`, `ATTACHMENTS_EDIT_ENABLED`, `ATTACHMENTS_RELEASE_ENABLED`) and limits (max bytes/count, allowed MIME, ClamAV toggle, storage roots).

2. **Database Bootstrap** (`simple_app.py:316`)
   - `init_database` now ensures:
     - `email_messages.attachments_manifest` (TEXT) and `version` (INTEGER) columns.
     - `email_attachments`, `email_release_locks`, `idempotency_keys` tables.
     - Attachment storage directories are created based on config roots.

3. **Backend Attachment APIs** (`app/routes/interception.py`)
   - `_ensure_attachments_extracted` parses raw MIME, saves originals under `attachments/<email_id>/`, stores metadata rows, and returns serialized attachment rows.
   - `GET /api/email/<id>/attachments` supplies attachments list + manifest version when UI flag enabled.
   - `GET /api/attachment/<id>/download` streams original/staged files with path safety checks.
   - Shared helpers for filename sanitization, SHA-256 hashing, storage root resolution.

4. **Frontend Integration**
   - `templates/base.html`: injects `window.ATTACHMENTS_FLAGS` so templates/JS can honor feature toggles.
   - `templates/emails_unified.html` & `templates/email_viewer.html`: added attachment panels wired to new API (read-only list + download) and skeleton placeholders.
   - `static/js/app.js`: introduced `MailAttach` namespace for fetching/rendering attachments, plus fallback download handler.
   - `static/css/main.css`: styled attachments panel, list rows, staged badge, skeleton shimmer.

## Findings & Notes
- **Existing release flow** still strips attachments only via `strip_attachments` flag. MIME rebuild with manifest logic remains pending (Phase 4).
- **Front-end button guards** remain unchanged; will be addressed when adding release lock/idempotency wiring.
- **Tests**: `pytest tests/test_intercept_flow.py` fails because file path doesn’t exist; suite structure differs from docs. Need updated test targets when backend pieces mature.
- **Dirty tree**: Pre-existing modifications in CSS/templates from earlier styling work; be careful when rebasing or preparing PR.
- **Storage dirs**: Config defaults point to relative `attachments/` and `attachments_staged/`. Ensure deployment hosts have write perms.

## Pending Work
1. **Phase 2 – Upload & Manifest Editing**
   - Endpoints: upload (multipart) with size/type enforcement, mark manifest actions, delete staged.
   - UI: DnD uploads, replace/remove controls (gated by `ATTACHMENTS_EDIT_ENABLED`).

2. **Phase 3 – Remove/Keep & Summary**
   - Extend manifest actions (keep/remove) and build pre-release summary UI.

3. **Phase 4 – Release Rebuild**
   - Integrate manifest-driven MIME rebuild, per-email locks (`email_release_locks`), idempotency keys, and post-success cleanup.
   - Add guarded buttons + spinner states across modal/viewer.

4. **Phase 5 – Janitor & Metrics**
   - Scheduled cleanup for orphaned staged files, Prometheus metrics + audit logging.

5. **Testing & Verification**
   - Define updated pytest targets (identify actual test modules covering interception/attachments).
   - Browser verification via Chrome DevTools once Phase 2 UI interactions exist.

6. **Documentation Updates**
   - Refresh `docs/INTERCEPTION_IMPLEMENTATION.md`, `docs/USER_GUIDE.md`, and `/templates/styleguide.html` after Phase 2/3 UI finalize.

## Resumption Checklist
- Confirm feature flags in `.env` / config before testing (`ATTACHMENTS_UI_ENABLED=true` for read-only preview).
- Run `python simple_app.py` and validate attachments panel surfaces originals for held emails.
- Plan next iteration: start with upload API + staged manifest editing.
- Monitor `git status` for unrelated dirty files; coordinate before commit/PR.

─ Worked for 1m 10s ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

• Created progress/ with an in-progress/2025-10-24_attachments-foundation.md log capturing the current
  feature state, tooling usage (Serena/desktop-commander), development guidelines, findings, and
  the next action queue. The doc now sits in the repo root for future Codex sessions to resume work
  seamlessly.


› are all your changes commited to git? I am not seeing any changes!!


• Nothing’s been committed yet—I’ve only staged the work in the filesystem so we could review it first.
  To see the diffs you can run:

  git status
  git diff

  If everything looks right and you’re ready to checkpoint it, go ahead and commit with your preferred
  message (e.g., git commit -am "Phase 1 attachments foundation"), then push whenever you’re ready. Let
  me know if you’d like me to prep specific staging/commit commands.
