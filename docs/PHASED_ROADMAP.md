**Problem**: 130 LOC duplicated across blueprints

**Solution**:
- Extract shared utilities to `app/utils/email_helpers.py`
- Common functions: `parse_recipients()`, `sanitize_subject()`, `extract_body()`
- Update all blueprints to import from central location

**Deliverables**:
- Single source of truth for email parsing

1. **Fix Rate Limit Tests** (2-3 hours) - MEDIUM
   - Update `tests/utils/test_rate_limiting.py` to work with auth fixtures
   - Validate 429 responses are actually returned
   - Ensure headers are present

2. **Add Error Injection Tests** (3-4 hours) - HIGH
   - Mock STARTTLS failures â†’ verify warning logs
   - Mock IMAP logout errors â†’ verify debug logs
   - Validate all 13 fixed error handlers actually execute

3. **Documentation Review** (1-2 hours) - HIGH
   - Update CLAUDE.md with link to OBSERVABILITY_GUIDE.md
   - Add "Monitoring" section to README (if exists)
   - Document rate limit configuration in .env.example

4. **Performance Baseline** (2-3 hours) - MEDIUM
   - Run `pytest --benchmark` on fetch/release/edit endpoints
   - Document p95 latency before/after logging changes
   - Verify no significant performance regression

**Total Effort**: 8-12 hours (~1-2 days)

---

### Short-Term Focus (Next 2-4 Weeks)

**Recommended**: Phase 4 (Test Coverage Expansion)

**Why**:
- Validates current implementation correctness
- Catches regressions early
- Builds confidence for future changes
- Relatively low-risk (tests don't affect production)

**Milestones**:
- Week 1: Integration tests (IMAP watcher, SMTP proxy)
- Week 2: Security tests (CSRF, rate limiting, auth)
- Week 3: Error path tests (inject failures, verify logging)
- Week 4: Performance baseline (latency, load, memory)

**Expected Outcome**: 50%+ coverage, solid test foundation

---

### Medium-Term Focus (Next 1-3 Months)

**Recommended**: Phase 5 (Production Hardening)

**Why**:
- Addresses known technical debt
- Improves maintainability
- Reduces operational surprises
- Prepares for gradual user growth

**Milestones**:
- Month 1: Helper consolidation + configuration management
- Month 2: Graceful degradation + logging enhancements
- Month 3: Monitor production metrics, iterate based on data

**Expected Outcome**: Mature, well-documented codebase

---

### Long-Term Focus (3-6 Months)

**Conditional**: Phase 6 (Scale-Up Preparation)

**When to Start**:
- User count >10
- Email volume >1000/day
- Multi-instance deployment needed
- Log volume exceeds 50MB/day

**Why Wait**:
- Don't optimize prematurely
- Let production usage guide priorities
- Avoid over-engineering for unused scale

**Expected Outcome**: Scales to 100+ users, 100k+ emails/day

## Risk Assessment

### Current Risks (Small Scale)

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| **IMAP auth failures** | Medium | High | Monitor `imap_connection_failures_total`, have backup accounts |
| **SMTP proxy crash** | Low | High | Add process supervisor (systemd), monitor `/healthz` |
| **Database corruption** | Very Low | Critical | WAL mode enabled, daily backups |
| **Log disk full** | Low | Medium | 50MB limit with rotation, monitor disk space |
| **Rate limit too strict** | Low | Low | User reports â†’ adjust env var â†’ restart |

### Scale-Up Risks (>10 Users)

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| **SQLite write contention** | High | High | Phase 6A: Multi-worker support or migrate to PostgreSQL |
| **Memory exhaustion** | Medium | Critical | Phase 6C: Background jobs, offload heavy operations |
| **Metric cardinality explosion** | Medium | Medium | Already mitigated: label normalization with 48-char limit |
| **Log storage growth** | High | Medium | Phase 6D: Log aggregation to external system |

## Decision Framework

### When to Start Next Phase?

**Phase 4 (Test Coverage)**: Start NOW
- Reason: Low-risk, high-value, validates current code
- No dependencies on production usage

**Phase 5 (Production Hardening)**: Start after Phase 4
- Reason: Builds on test confidence
- Can be done in parallel with initial production deployment

**Phase 6 (Scale-Up)**: Start only when metrics show need
- Triggers:
  - Active users >10
  - Email volume >5000/day
  - Response time p95 >2 seconds
  - Log rotation >2x/day
  - IMAP watcher failures >1/hour

**Phase 7 (Features)**: Start after Phase 5, prioritize by user feedback
- Reason: Stable foundation first
- Let users drive feature priorities

## Maintenance Burden Estimate

### Current State (Phases 0-3 Complete)

**Weekly Maintenance**: 2-4 hours
- Monitor metrics (`/metrics`, `/healthz`)
- Review logs for errors
- Rotate credentials (quarterly)

### After Phase 6 (At Scale)

**Weekly Maintenance**: 4-8 hours (increased operational complexity)
- Multi-instance coordination
- Log analysis across distributed system
- Performance optimization
