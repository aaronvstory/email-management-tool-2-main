# Codex Terminal Connection Fix

## Problem
The Codex container was disconnecting immediately after setup completion with the message "Terminal errored - An unexpected connection error occurred".

## Root Cause
The container was exiting after running its initial setup because there was no persistent process keeping it alive. The default Codex behavior runs setup commands and then terminates.

## Solution Applied
Created multiple layers of configuration to ensure the container stays alive:

### 1. Created Configuration Files

#### `codex.json` (Main configuration)
- Added `keepAlive: true` in multiple sections
- Configured `/bin/bash --login` as the persistent command
- Set `restartPolicy: "always"`
- Added proper shell initialization

#### `.codex/config.json` (Codex-specific config)
- Configured terminal profiles
- Set persistent workspace
- Defined entry points

#### `entrypoint.sh`
- Main initialization script
- Sets up environment variables
- Installs dependencies
- Ends with `exec /bin/bash --login` to keep container alive

#### `keep-alive.sh`
- Backup script to prevent container exit
- Creates minimal Flask app if needed
- Uses `exec` to replace process with bash

#### `startup.sh`
- Quick startup wrapper
- Handles missing dependencies
- Ensures bash is available

#### `.bashrc`
- Proper shell configuration
- Environment variables
- Aliases and utilities

## How to Apply the Fix

### Option 1: Restart Container (Recommended)
1. In your Codex environment, close all terminals
2. Restart the container:
   - Look for "Restart Container" or "Rebuild Container" option
   - Or refresh the browser page
3. The container should now stay connected

### Option 2: Manual Fix (If container is accessible)
```bash
# If you can briefly access the terminal, run:
chmod +x /workspace/*.sh
/workspace/startup.sh
```

### Option 3: Update Codex Settings
1. Ensure the repository has the new configuration files
2. Commit and push changes:
```bash
git add codex.json .codex/ *.sh .bashrc
git commit -m "Fix Codex container terminal connection"
git push
```
3. Reload the Codex environment

## Verification

After applying the fix, you should see:
```
================================================
  Email Management Tool - Development Container
================================================

Python: Python 3.11.x
Working directory: /workspace

Quick commands:
  runserver    - Start the Flask application
  startapp     - Alternative to start Flask
  pytest       - Run tests

Web interface available at: http://localhost:5000
================================================
```

And the terminal should remain connected without disconnecting.

## Key Changes Made

1. **Multiple `keepAlive: true` flags** - Ensures container doesn't terminate
2. **`exec /bin/bash --login`** - Replaces the script process with bash, preventing exit
3. **Trap signals** - Prevents terminal interrupts from killing the container
4. **Persistent workspace** - Maintains state between sessions
5. **Proper shell initialization** - Ensures bash is properly configured

## Troubleshooting

If the terminal still disconnects:

1. **Check Container Logs**
   - Look for any error messages during startup
   - Verify all scripts are being executed

2. **Verify Files Exist**
   ```bash
   ls -la *.sh
   cat codex.json
   ```

3. **Force Terminal Connection**
   - Try different terminal types in Codex settings
   - Use "bash" instead of default shell

4. **Alternative Connection**
   - If web terminal fails, try SSH if available
   - Use VS Code Remote Containers extension

## Files Created/Modified

- `codex.json` - Main Codex configuration
- `.codex/config.json` - Additional Codex settings
- `entrypoint.sh` - Container initialization script
- `keep-alive.sh` - Container persistence script
- `startup.sh` - Quick startup wrapper
- `.bashrc` - Shell configuration
- `fix-terminal.sh` - Emergency fix script
- `.devcontainer/` - VS Code dev container config (backup)

All scripts are designed to work together to ensure the container stays alive and the terminal remains connected.
