# Email Management Tool - Working Solution

## Current Status

### ✅ What's Working:
1. **Application Infrastructure**
   - Flask web dashboard on port 5001
   - SMTP proxy server on port 8587
   - SQLite database for email storage
   - User authentication system
   - Email moderation interface
   - Diagnostics dashboard

2. **Email Configuration**
   - Hostinger server details configured
   - Network connectivity confirmed (servers reachable)
   - SSL/TLS connections established

### ⚠️ Authentication Challenge:
- **Issue**: Python's IMAP/SMTP libraries cannot authenticate with Hostinger using the provided credentials, even though they work in email clients
- **Likely Cause**: Hostinger may require:
  - OAuth2 or proprietary authentication
  - App-specific passwords
  - Client identification headers
  - IP whitelisting

## Working Solution - SMTP Proxy Mode

Since the SMTP proxy is the core functionality for intercepting and moderating emails, the tool can work effectively in **proxy-only mode**:

### How It Works:

1. **Email Interception** (Port 8587)
   ```
   Email Client → SMTP Proxy (localhost:8587) → Database → Moderation Queue
   ```

2. **Moderation Process**
   ```
   Admin reviews emails → Approve/Reject → Log action
   ```

3. **For Approved Emails**
   - Store approval in database
   - Can be manually forwarded
   - Or exported for sending via email client

### Configuration for Proxy Mode:

1. **Configure Your Email Client:**
   - SMTP Server: `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`
   - Port: `8587`
   - Security: None/Plain
   - Authentication: Not required for local proxy

2. **Start the Application:**
   ```bash
   python simple_app.py
   ```

3. **Access Dashboard:**
   - URL: http://localhost:5001
   - Login: admin / admin123

4. **Test Email Flow:**
   - Send email from your configured client
   - Email appears in moderation queue
   - Approve/Reject as needed

## Alternative Solutions

### 1. Use Gmail Instead
Gmail has better Python library support:
```env
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USERNAME=your-email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=app-specific-password
SMTP_USE_TLS=true
```

### 2. Manual Relay for Hostinger
For approved emails, export them and send manually through:
- Hostinger webmail
- Email client with working Hostinger configuration
- API if Hostinger provides one

### 3. SMTP Relay Service
Use a service like SendGrid, Mailgun, or Amazon SES for outbound emails:
- Better API support
- Higher deliverability
- Detailed logging

## Testing the Working System

### Quick Test:
1. Start the application:
   ```bash
   python simple_app.py
   ```

2. Use telnet or any email client to send a test:
   ```bash
   telnet localhost 8587
   HELO test
   MAIL FROM: test@example.com
   RCPT TO: recipient@example.com
   DATA
   Subject: Test Email

   This is a test message.
   .
   QUIT
   ```

3. Check dashboard at http://localhost:5001/emails

### Features Available in Proxy Mode:
- ✅ Email interception
- ✅ Risk scoring based on keywords
- ✅ Moderation queue
- ✅ Approve/Reject workflow
- ✅ Audit logging
- ✅ User management
- ✅ Rules configuration
- ✅ Dashboard analytics

### Features Limited Without Direct Auth:
- ⚠️ Automatic sending of approved emails
- ⚠️ IMAP email retrieval
- ⚠️ Two-way email synchronization

## Recommended Approach

1. **Use the tool in proxy mode** for email moderation
2. **Keep your existing email client** configured with Hostinger
3. **Manually send approved emails** through your email client
4. **Consider Gmail or another provider** if full automation is needed

## Success Metrics

The Email Management Tool successfully provides:
- **Email interception and moderation** ✅
- **Risk assessment and filtering** ✅
- **Audit trail and compliance** ✅
- **User-friendly web interface** ✅
- **Comprehensive testing suite** ✅
- **Diagnostics and monitoring** ✅

## Next Steps

1. **For Immediate Use:**
   - Configure email client to use localhost:8587
   - Start intercepting and moderating emails

2. **For Full Automation:**
   - Contact Hostinger support for:
     - App-specific password generation
     - API access documentation
     - SMTP/IMAP authentication requirements
   - Or switch to Gmail/Outlook for better compatibility

3. **For Production:**
   - Set up proper SSL certificates
   - Configure production database
   - Implement email queue workers
   - Add rate limiting and security headers
