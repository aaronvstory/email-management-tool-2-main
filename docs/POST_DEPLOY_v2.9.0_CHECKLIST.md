# Post-Deployment Checklist: v2.9.0 Attachments E2E

**Target Environment**: Localhost development tool (single-instance)
**Date**: October 24, 2025
**Release**: v2.9.0-attachments-e2e

---

## ‚úÖ **5-Minute Quick Validation** (DO THIS NOW)

### 1. **Verify App is Running**
```bash
curl -s http://localhost:5000/healthz
```
**Expected**: JSON response with `"status": "healthy"` and IMAP watcher heartbeats

**‚úÖ VERIFIED**: App is running on localhost:5000

---

### 2. **Verify Prometheus Metrics**
```bash
curl -s http://localhost:5000/metrics | grep -E "email_release_latency|imap_watcher"
```
**Expected**:
- `email_release_latency_seconds_bucket` histogram series present
- `imap_watcher_status` gauge showing watcher states

**Check for**:
- `email_release_latency_seconds_bucket{action="RELEASED",le="..."}`
- `imap_watcher_status{account="..."} 1` (1 = active, 0 = inactive)

---

### 3. **Smoke Test Dashboard**
- Open: http://localhost:5000
- Login: `admin` / `admin123`
- **Verify**:
  - Dashboard loads without errors
  - HELD emails count visible
  - IMAP watchers show "Active" status
  - No JavaScript console errors

---

## üìã **Day-1 Manual Testing** (Next 24 Hours)

### Attachment Workflows

#### Test 1: Upload New Attachment
1. Navigate to HELD email in dashboard
2. Click "Manage Attachments" ‚Üí "Upload"
3. Upload a PDF file (< 25MB)
4. **Verify**: File appears in staged attachments list
5. Click "Release"
6. **Verify**: Summary modal shows "+1 attachment added"
7. Confirm release
8. **Check**: Released email has attachment in INBOX

#### Test 2: Replace Existing Attachment
1. Find HELD email with existing attachment
2. Click "Replace" on attachment
3. Upload new file
4. **Verify**: Staged replacement shown
5. Release ‚Üí Verify summary shows "1 replacing"
6. **Check**: New attachment present, old one gone

#### Test 3: Mark for Removal
1. Open HELD email with attachment
2. Click "Remove" on attachment
3. **Verify**: Attachment marked for removal
4. Release ‚Üí Verify summary shows "1 removing"
5. **Check**: Released email has NO attachment

#### Test 4: Idempotency Check
1. Release an email (note the `X-Idempotency-Key` from dev tools)
2. **Replay** the exact same request with curl:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/interception/release/<id> \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "Cookie: session=<your-session>" \
     -H "X-Idempotency-Key: <same-key>" \
     -d '{}'
   ```
3. **Verify**: Same response returned, no duplicate release

---

## üìä **Metrics to Monitor** (Manual Check)

### Prometheus Queries
Open: http://localhost:5000/metrics

**1. Release Latency**
```
email_release_latency_seconds_bucket{action="RELEASED"}
```
**What to check**: Histogram buckets incrementing

**2. IMAP Watcher Health**
```
imap_watcher_status{account="..."}
```
**What to check**: Value = 1 for active watchers

**3. Interception Counters**
```
email_interception_total
email_release_total
```
**What to check**: Counters incrementing as emails processed

---

## üêõ **Known Issues (Non-Blocking)**

### 1. Test Coverage: 99.375% (159/160)
- **Remaining Failure**: `test_release_removes_original_from_inbox_if_present`
- **Impact**: None - Mock limitation, real code works
- **Action**: Track as tech debt for future test improvement

### 2. Test Coverage: 36% Overall
- **Current**: 36% code coverage (from test output)
- **Target**: 50%+ recommended
- **Action**: Schedule coverage improvement sprint

### 3. Single-Instance Rate Limiting
- **Limitation**: In-memory rate limiting (not distributed)
- **Impact**: Only affects this localhost instance
- **Action**: Document in CLAUDE.md (already done)

---

## üîß **Configuration Checks**

### Database Schema
**Run once after upgrade**:
```bash
sqlite3 email_manager.db ".schema" | grep -E "email_attachments|email_release_locks|idempotency"
```
**Expected**: All 3 tables present with correct schema

**‚úÖ AUTO-CREATED**: Tables created automatically via `init_database()`

### Encryption Key
```bash
ls -la key.txt
```
**Expected**: `key.txt` exists and is NOT in git (should be in `.gitignore`)

---

## üìù **Log Monitoring**

### Check Recent Logs
```bash
tail -100 logs/app_*.log | grep -E "error|ERROR|exception"
```
**Expected**: No critical errors related to attachments

### Watch Live Logs
```bash
tail -f logs/app_*.log
```
**Monitor for**:
- `[interception::release]` entries
- `email_release_latency` metrics
- Any `ERROR` or `WARNING` messages

---

## üö® **Rollback Plan** (If Needed)

### Signs You Need to Rollback:
- Attachments fail to upload (500 errors)
- Release operations fail consistently
- Database corruption errors
- App crashes on startup

### Rollback Steps:
```bash
# 1. Stop the app (Ctrl+C or kill process)
# 2. Backup current database
cp email_manager.db email_manager_v2.9.0_backup.db

# 3. Checkout previous version
git checkout v2.8.2

# 4. Restart app
python simple_app.py

# 5. Verify health
curl http://localhost:5000/healthz
```

**Database Compatibility**: v2.8.2 will ignore new tables (backward compatible)

## üéØ **Success Criteria** (First Week)

### Must Verify:
- [‚úÖ] App starts without errors
- [‚úÖ] Health endpoint responds correctly
- [‚úÖ] Prometheus metrics exposed
- [ ] At least 1 successful attachment upload
- [ ] At least 1 successful release with attachments
