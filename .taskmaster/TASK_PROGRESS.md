# Task Progress Log

- 2025-10-31T01:52:37-07:00 — Initialized Task Master backlog, marked Tasks 1/3/6/7/8/9/10/12 in progress, verified health check on port 5001 twice, added scripts/smoke.ps1 and executed baseline smoke run (SMOKE OK).
- 2025-10-31T02:21:40-07:00 — Hardened watcher start/stop API payloads (`app/routes/accounts.py`), added regression tests (`tests/routes/test_accounts_watcher_api.py`), refreshed smoke harness (`scripts/smoke.ps1`/`smoke.bat`) and exercised pytest suite; smoke script currently fails against the live server until the new watcher JSON shape is served.
