# GPT-5 CODEX TASKMASTER BRIEF
**Date**: October 30, 2025  
**Urgency**: CRITICAL - Working system needed by tomorrow  
**Previous Context**: Current AI (Claude) losing focus, making excuses, inflating estimates  

## ðŸš¨ MISSION: GET EMAIL MANAGEMENT WORKING TONIGHT/TOMORROW

### SITUATION SUMMARY
- **Current repo** (feat/styleguide-refresh): Modern Stitch UI, broken core features
- **Backup repo** (main): Functional but 50% watcher success, visual issues
- **Goal**: Pick the better foundation and GET IT WORKING ASAP

### IMMEDIATE PRIORITY (NEXT 12 HOURS)
**NOT** analysis paralysis. **NOT** multi-week roadmaps. **WORKING SYSTEM.**

### PHASE 1: RAPID REPO ASSESSMENT (1 hour max)
Test both repos for core functionality:

**Critical Test Checklist:**
1. âœ… Startup: Does repo start without errors?
2. âœ… Login: Authentication works?
3. âœ… Dashboard: Email list loads?
4. âœ… Interception: Send â†’ Intercept â†’ Release workflow?
5. âœ… Attachments: Download works without 500 errors?
6. âœ… Watchers: Start/stop email monitoring?

**Decision Rule:**
- If **backup repo** passes 4+ tests: USE BACKUP AS BASE
- If **current repo** passes 4+ tests: FIX CURRENT ISSUES
- If **both fail** equally: Use backup (cleaner architecture)

### PHASE 2: SYSTEMATIC FIXING (6-12 hours)
Based on assessment, pick ONE repo and fix the top 3 blocking issues:

**Common Issues to Fix:**
1. **Interception Test Suite** - Must work bi-directionally
2. **Attachment System** - No 500 errors, reliable download
3. **Watcher Reliability** - Improve success rate to 80%+

**Success Criteria for Each Fix:**
- âœ… **Manually tested** - click buttons, verify workflows
- âœ… **Screenshot proof** - show working functionality
- âœ… **No regressions** - existing features still work

### PHASE 3: PRODUCTION READY (4-6 hours)
1. **Visual polish**: Fix obvious UI issues (professional appearance)
2. **Error handling**: User-friendly error messages
3. **Basic testing**: Core workflows work reliably
4. **Documentation**: What works, what doesn't

## ðŸŽ¯ EXECUTION CONSTRAINTS

### DAILY DELIVERABLES REQUIRED
- **Hour 1**: Repo assessment results
- **Hour 4**: First critical fix working
- **Hour 8**: Second critical fix working  
- **Hour 12**: Third critical fix working
- **Hour 16**: Production-ready system

### NO EXCUSES POLICY
- No "this will take weeks" estimates
- No claiming fixes without testing
- No oversimplifying complex features
- No forgetting previous context/tasks

### TESTING INTEGRITY
- **Click every button** - don't just check if pages render
- **Test workflows end-to-end** - send â†’ intercept â†’ edit â†’ release
- **Verify with screenshots** - proof that features work
- **Document failures honestly** - what doesn't work yet

## ðŸš€ SPECIFIC FOCUS AREAS

### IF USING BACKUP REPO:
1. **Fix failing test suite** - debug what's breaking
2. **Improve watcher reliability** - identify why 50% success rate
3. **Address visual issues** - make it look professional
4. **Cherry-pick modern elements** - from current repo if beneficial

### IF USING CURRENT REPO:  
1. **Fix attachment 500 errors** - implement defensive error handling
2. **Complete interception test suite** - restore full functionality
3. **Fix release/discard actions** - resolve NameError issues
4. **Polish email edit page** - basic attachment management

## ðŸ’» TECHNICAL APPROACH

### USE SYSTEMATIC DEBUGGING:
- **Step 1**: Reproduce error with exact steps
- **Step 2**: Identify root cause with logging/debugging
- **Step 3**: Implement minimal fix that addresses root cause
- **Step 4**: Test fix manually (click buttons)
- **Step 5**: Verify no regressions introduced

### DEVELOPMENT BEST PRACTICES:
- Clear Python bytecode cache after import changes: `python -B app.py`
- Test with fresh browser session to avoid caching issues
- Commit working fixes immediately - don't accumulate changes
- Use git branches for experimental fixes

## ðŸ“Š SUCCESS METRICS

**MINIMUM VIABLE WORKING SYSTEM:**
- âœ… **Authentication**: Login/logout works
- âœ… **Email Management**: View, edit, compose emails
- âœ… **Interception**: Send â†’ Intercept â†’ Edit â†’ Release workflow  
- âœ… **Attachments**: Upload/download without errors
- âœ… **Monitoring**: Basic watcher functionality
- âœ… **UI**: Professional appearance, no obvious bugs

**TIMELINE**: Working system by end of tomorrow (October 31, 2025)

**ACCOUNTABILITY**: Hourly progress updates with proof of working features

## ðŸŽ¯ EXECUTION PRIORITY

**FUNCTIONALITY > STYLING > POLISH**

Get the core email workflows working first. Visual improvements are secondary to having a system that actually functions for email management, interception, and attachment handling.

**Ready to execute systematic fixing approach with daily deliverables and honest testing.**
